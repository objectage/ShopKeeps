# ShopKeeps -  A Retail Store Management Backend

This repository holds the backend logic for a retail store application designed to facilitate interaction between store staff and customers during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This system aims to help retail stores manage their operations more efficiently by providing an interface for staff to handle stocks and orders while maintaining safety protocols.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Includes pages for login and signup, allowing staff to securely access the system.
- **Stock Handler**: Manages stock information, enabling staff to update, add, or remove stock items.
- **Order Handler**: Processes customer orders, keeping track of order statuses and details.

## Technologies

- **MySQL**: Used for database management, storing user, stock, and order data.
- **Python MySQL Connector**: Allows the Python code to communicate with the MySQL database.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Serves as the development environment where the backend logic was written and tested.

## Project Structure

The backend logic is encapsulated into functions within a Jupyter Notebook. These functions are ready to be exported into a `.py` file for integration with front-end applications. The project is structured into three main sections:

- **Login/Signup**: Handles the authentication process.
- **StockHandler**: Contains functions to manage stock data.
- **OrderHandler**: Comprises functions to manage order processing.

Additionally, the DDL (Data Definition Language) script for setting up the database is provided.

## Setup

To set up this backend:

1. Ensure you have Python and MySQL installed.
2. Set up the MySQL database using the provided DDL script.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to access the functions.
4. To integrate with a front end, export the functions to a `.py` file and import them into your front-end codebase.

## Learning and Development Experience

This project was an insightful journey into the world of full-stack development and database management in school times, where i started out my computer science journey. It was conceived during the onset of COVID-19 as a practical response to real-world challenges, teaching me the importance of agile development and rapid prototyping. The experience deepened my understanding of how backend systems are architected and the critical role they play in driving business efficiency. Although plans for an analytics module were not realized, the project laid a strong foundation for future expansion and learning in data-driven decision-making for business optimization.
